# Facial-Expression
🚀 Real-Time Facial Expression Detection using OpenCV & Deep Learning! 🎭

I'm excited to share my latest project – a Real-Time Facial Expression Recognition System! 🧠💡 This model detects and classifies human emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Neutral, and more in real-time using OpenCV, Deep Learning, and CNNs.

📌 Key Features:
✔ Real-time emotion detection using a webcam 📷
✔ Built with OpenCV, Python, and Deep Learning (CNNs) 🧠
✔ Trained on the FER-2013 dataset for accurate predictions
✔ Optimized for fast and efficient real-time performance

🔹 Tech Stack: OpenCV | TensorFlow/Keras | Python | Deep Learning | CNN

💡 Working Approach:
1️⃣ Captures real-time facial expressions using OpenCV
2️⃣ Preprocesses the image and applies a CNN model for classification
3️⃣ Displays the detected emotion on the screen in real-time

🖥️ Results: (Check out the attached images/screenshots!)

This project was a great learning experience, improving my knowledge of computer vision, deep learning, and real-time processing! Excited to explore more in AI and Machine Learning. 🚀

Let’s connect and discuss enhancements! What other features would you add to this system? 🤔💬
